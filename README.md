# vue-WasteLabels
Tossed these components together to represent waste labels as I needed for my project. They are rough.

.vue files for creating Hazardous Waste, Non-Hazardous Waste, Universal Waste, and Non-regulated waste labels.

Built with the Lato font from fonts.google.com

Pacakaging pending when I have the time to learn how things needs be set up. Until then, individual files suffice.
